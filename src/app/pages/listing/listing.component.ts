Begin in the center of the city, passing by Constitution Square (Syntagma), the House of Parliament, the Memorial to the Unknown Soldier and the National Library. On-route to the Acropolis you will see Hadrianâ€™s Arch, the Temple of Olympian Zeus and a quick stop at Panathenaic Stadium, where the first Modern Olympic Games were held in 1896. During the Acropolis visit witness the architectural masterpieces of the Golden Age of Athens: the Propylaea, the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion and finally the famous Parthenon. Your first taste of Athens would not be complete without a visit to the Acropolis Museum, a modern architectural building where you can admire the wonders and architectural masterpieces of the classical era. Return to your hotel with the remainder of your day at leisure. Overnight stay in Athens. Please note: At the Athens Acropolis, the terrain is quite uneven underfoot and includes a number of stairs. It may not be suitable for those with reduced mobility. Return transfer to your hotel is included; however, once the tour ends, you will have the option to stay in the downtown area if you prefer to continue exploring the city. Note: This activity can accommodate a maximum of 50 people, and visitors will have access to audio guides during the tour.',
